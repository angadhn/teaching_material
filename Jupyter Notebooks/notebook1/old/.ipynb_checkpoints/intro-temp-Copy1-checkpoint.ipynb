    "# Session 0 - Using Jupyter Notebooks\n",
    "\n",
    "## A brief introduction\n",
    "\n",
    "Jupyter notebooks are built on the `python` programming language, which itself was designed to offer a clear and simple coding experience. Python code can be run in many ways, meaning you don't necessarily need a Jupyter notebook to perform the tasks you will learn in these sessions. However, Jupyter allows for the easy communication, visualisation and sharing of python code and so we will take advantage of these benefits.\n",
    "\n",
    "## Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter website (https://jupyter.org/) contains many good interactive resources and online documentation for learning about Jupyter notebooks and experimenting with examples. In addition...\n",

For example, run the cell above for which you previously entered `x`. This should now output 11. Moreover, the number inside of the `Out[.]` should change, this indicates the order in which the cells have been run.\n"
