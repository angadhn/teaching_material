    "\n",
    "We will be running `python` code using an interactive notebook, running in a web browser. We refer to the notebook a 'iPythn notebook' (older name) or 'Jupyter notebook' (newer name). Python code can be run in many ways, meaning you don't necessarily need a Jupyter notebook to run a Python program. However, the notebook has two advantages for data analysis:\n",
    "  1. It runs in a web browser, making it easy to display graphs created by your data analysis program.\n",
    "  2. The program code is combined with formatted text describing the results of the analysis. It encourages us to think that we are creating a document, not just code.\n",
    "\n",
    "The aim of this short notebook is to introduce the capabilities of notebooks.\n",
    "\n",
    "### Section 1.1 Resources\n",
    "\n",
    "The Jupyter website (https://jupyter.org/) contains many good interactive resources and online documentation for learning about Jupyter notebooks and experimenting with examples. In addition...\n",

    "#### User Interface Tour\n",
    "Click on the help menu and select `user interface tour`. A pop up menu will appear. Then use the keyboard arrow keys to see some of the functionality offered by Jupyter notebooks.\n",

    "\n",
    "* Create a new cell below this one\n",

    "\n",
    "You should see the output has changed to 11.\n",
    "\n",
    "**IMPORTANT** - This brings us to a key aspect of Jupyter: The outputs depend on the order on which you run the cells, not the way they are order in the notebook. For example, if you run the cell assigning 3, `x` will again be 3.  The number inside of the `Out[.]` should change, this indicates the order in which the cells have been run. \n",
    "  * It is very useful to be able to run cells in any order when you are working interactively\n",
    "  * It is recommended that when you have finished, the cells of the notebook are arranged in the order in which they should be run.\n"
